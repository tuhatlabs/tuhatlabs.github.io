I embrace my desire to feel the RHYTHM
I 
embrace 
my desire 
to feel inspired
I embrace my desire to 
fathom the power I embrace my desire to
witness the beauty I embrace my desire to bathe in the fountain I
embrace my desire to swing on the spiral
I embrace my desire to
swing on the
spiral of
our
DIVINITY
I embrace my desire to still be a human?
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself
Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin
I'm reaching up and reaching out
I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me
Following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been
We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been
